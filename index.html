					<h3>About</h3>
						<p>Our peer mentorship program pairs upper year students who have
							lived experience with mental illness with 1st	and 2nd year students
							who are struggling with self-care and their mental health on campus.
							All mentors are safeTalk certified and equipped with on and off
							campus resources available to students.<br><br>

							Mentees and Mentors will meet on a monthly basis (at minimum), and
							will spend the semester working through a WRAP workbook to create
							a personalized crisis plan. Mentors are encouraged to discuss
							personal experiences with mental illness and strategies used to
							overcome their adversity.
						</p>

						<h4>Mentor applications will be open in the fall.</h4>

Sunny is an advocate for Healthy Minds because she realizes the importance of balancing her mental, physical and spiritual well-being while living a busy life.
